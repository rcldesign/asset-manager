# Webhook Enhancements Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the webhook enhancements implemented for Phase 4 of the DumbAssets Enhanced project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Updated `WebhookEventType` enum in `prisma/schema.prisma` to include all new event types:
  - Phase 4 specific: `audit_created`, `report_generated`, `report_scheduled`, `backup_created`, `backup_restored`, `sync_completed`, `gdpr_export_requested`, `gdpr_deletion_requested`
  - Additional events: `task_deleted`, `task_overdue`, `schedule_created`, `schedule_updated`, `schedule_deleted`, `user_invited`, `user_joined`, `user_deactivated`, `maintenance_started`, `maintenance_completed`, `warranty_expiring`, `warranty_expired`

### 2. TypeScript Types and Interfaces
- Created `src/types/webhook-payloads.ts` with:
  - Comprehensive payload interfaces for each event type
  - Enhanced base event interface with organization and user context
  - Type mapping for strongly-typed webhook events
  - Helper types for webhook users, organizations, locations, assets, and tasks

### 3. Webhook Service Enhancements
- Updated `src/services/webhook.service.ts`:
  - Added `createEnhancedEvent()` method for creating events with full context
  - Updated `emitEvent()` to support both legacy and enhanced formats
  - Modified `deliverWebhook()` to handle both payload formats
  - Added all new event types to the `WebhookEventType` type

### 4. Service Integrations

#### Audit Service (`src/services/audit.service.ts`)
- Emits `audit.created` events when audit records are created
- Includes full audit details, user information, and affected entity context

#### Reporting Service (`src/services/reporting.service.ts`)
- Added `generateAndExportReport()` method that emits `report.generated` events
- Includes report metadata, format, and optional download URLs

#### GDPR Compliance Service (`src/services/gdpr-compliance.service.ts`)
- Emits `gdpr.export_requested` when data exports are completed
- Emits `gdpr.deletion_requested` when data deletions are processed
- Includes affected data counts and request details

#### Offline Sync Service (`src/services/offline-sync.service.ts`)
- Emits `sync.completed` events after successful PWA data synchronization
- Includes sync summary with upload/download counts and conflict information

#### Backup Service (`src/services/backup.service.ts`)
- Emits `backup.created` events when backups are created
- Emits `backup.restored` events when data is restored
- Includes entity counts and backup metadata

#### Asset Service (`src/services/asset.service.ts`)
- Enhanced `asset.created` webhook with location and parent asset details
- Enhanced `asset.updated` webhook with before/after values and change tracking
- Enhanced `asset.deleted` webhook with child asset information

#### Task Enhancement Service (`src/services/task-enhancement.service.ts`)
- Enhanced `task.completed` webhook with completion details and checklist progress
- Added `task.assigned` webhook emission
- Added `maintenance.completed` webhook for maintenance tasks

### 5. Documentation
- Created `docs/WEBHOOK_ENHANCEMENTS.md` with:
  - Complete list of new event types
  - Enhanced payload format documentation
  - Event-specific payload structures
  - Migration guide and examples
  - Security considerations

### 6. API Documentation
- Updated `src/docs/swagger.ts` to include `WebhookEventType` enum with all event types

### 7. Testing
- Created `src/test/unit/services/webhook-enhancements.test.ts` with:
  - Tests for enhanced event creation
  - Event type coverage tests
  - Payload structure validation
  - Backward compatibility tests

## Key Features

### Enhanced Event Payloads
All new events include:
- Organization context (id, name)
- Triggering user details (id, email, name, role)
- Timestamp and unique event ID
- Event-specific data with related entities
- Metadata with version indicator

### Backward Compatibility
- Legacy webhook format is still supported
- Services fallback to legacy format when user context is unavailable
- Webhook delivery handles both formats transparently

### Related Entity Data
Events include relevant related data:
- Assets include location and template information
- Tasks include asset and schedule details
- Users include role information
- All entities include display names for better context

### Change Tracking
Update events include:
- Array of changed fields
- Before and after values for each change
- Related entity changes (e.g., location changes include both old and new location details)

## Migration Path

1. Run Prisma migration to update the database schema:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name add_phase_4_webhook_events
   ```

2. Update webhook consumers to:
   - Check `metadata.version` to determine payload format
   - Handle both legacy and enhanced formats
   - Use TypeScript types for type safety

3. Gradually migrate webhook subscriptions to use new event types

## Benefits

1. **Better Context**: Every event includes full organization and user context
2. **Audit Trail**: Enhanced events provide complete audit trail information
3. **Type Safety**: Strongly-typed payloads prevent errors
4. **Flexibility**: Support for both old and new formats during transition
5. **Rich Data**: Events include all relevant related entity data
6. **Change Visibility**: Update events clearly show what changed

## Next Steps

1. Update frontend to display new webhook event types in configuration
2. Add webhook event filtering by user or entity
3. Implement webhook retry with exponential backoff
4. Add webhook event deduplication
5. Create webhook testing endpoints
