# Dependency Injection Test Update Summary

## Changes Applied

Successfully updated the following test files to use the dependency injection pattern for PrismaClient:

### 1. `/home/topher/repos/asset-manager/backend/src/test/unit/services/data-import.service.simple.test.ts`
- Added `jest.mock('../../../lib/prisma');` at the top
- Added import for prisma after mocking: `import { prisma } from '../../../lib/prisma';`
- Created mock: `const mockPrisma = prisma as jest.Mocked<typeof prisma>;`
- Updated service instantiation: `new DataImportService(mockPrisma)`

### 2. `/home/topher/repos/asset-manager/backend/src/test/unit/services/gdpr-compliance.service.simple.test.ts`
- Added `jest.mock('../../../lib/prisma');` at the top
- Added import for prisma after mocking: `import { prisma } from '../../../lib/prisma';`
- Created mock: `const mockPrisma = prisma as jest.Mocked<typeof prisma>;`
- Updated service instantiation: `new GDPRComplianceService(mockPrisma)`

### 3. `/home/topher/repos/asset-manager/backend/src/test/unit/services/gdpr-compliance.service.comprehensive.test.ts`
- Already had the mock in place
- Added: `const mockPrisma = prisma as jest.Mocked<typeof prisma>;`
- Updated service instantiation: `new GDPRComplianceService(mockPrisma)`

### 4. `/home/topher/repos/asset-manager/backend/src/test/unit/services/dashboard.service.test.ts`
- Added `jest.mock('../../../lib/prisma');` at the top
- Replaced import from test singleton to direct prisma import
- Created mock: `const mockPrisma = prisma as jest.Mocked<typeof prisma>;`
- Updated service instantiation: `new DashboardService(mockPrisma)`
- Replaced all instances of `prismaMock` with `mockPrisma` throughout the file

## Pattern Applied

The consistent pattern across all files is:

```typescript
// 1. Mock prisma before any imports
jest.mock('../../../lib/prisma');

// 2. Import after mocking
import { prisma } from '../../../lib/prisma';

// 3. Create typed mock
const mockPrisma = prisma as jest.Mocked<typeof prisma>;

// 4. Use in service instantiation
service = new ServiceName(mockPrisma);
```

## Notes

- All services now use dependency injection for PrismaClient
- Tests maintain their existing functionality while using the injected mock
- The pattern is consistent across all updated files
- No complex mocking setups were modified, focusing on minimal changes for dependency injection
