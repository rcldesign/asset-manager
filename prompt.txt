Perfect timing! Here are the search results on Prisma recursive CTEs:

**Key Findings:**

1. **Prisma Limitation:** Prisma doesn't natively support recursive CTEs yet (ongoing GitHub issue #3725)

2. **Available Workarounds:**
   - **Limited Depth Queries:** Manually build nested includes with max depth
   - **Raw SQL Queries:** Use `$queryRaw` with proper WITH RECURSIVE CTEs
   - **Database Views:** Create PostgreSQL views with recursive logic

3. **Raw SQL Structure for Tasks:**
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE task_tree AS (
  -- Base case: select the starting task
  SELECT id, "parentTaskId", title, status, "subtaskOrder", 0 as depth
  FROM tasks
  WHERE id = $1
  
  UNION ALL
  
  -- Recursive case: select children
  SELECT t.id, t."parentTaskId", t.title, t.status, t."subtaskOrder", tt.depth + 1
  FROM tasks t
  INNER JOIN task_tree tt ON t."parentTaskId" = tt.id
)
SELECT * FROM task_tree ORDER BY depth, "subtaskOrder";
```

4. **Schema Setup:** Current schema already has proper self-referencing setup with `onDelete: Cascade`

**Strategic Decision:**
Given the time constraints and need for rapid implementation, I recommend:

**Option A (Fast):** Limited depth approach (max 3-4 levels) for MVP, with recursive raw SQL as enhancement later
**Option B (Complete):** Implement raw SQL recursive queries immediately using `$queryRaw`

For maximum velocity while ensuring robustness, I lean toward **Option A** for now - implement the transactional completion logic first (most critical), use limited depth includes for retrieval (sufficient for most real-world use cases), and note recursive raw SQL as technical debt.

Should I proceed with implementing the enhanced TaskService with:
1. Transactional parent-child completion logic (your excellent guidance)
2. Limited depth subtask retrieval (3-4 levels) 
3. Proper `subtaskOrder` management
4. Multi-user assignment logic

Then move to @mentions and activity streams? This maintains momentum while covering the core functionality.
