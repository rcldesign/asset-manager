## Test Execution Guidelines

### Environment Preparation
1. **Test Data Setup**: Use consistent test data across all test cases
2. **User Accounts**: Maintain dedicated test accounts for each role
3. **System Configuration**: Ensure all integrations (SMTP, OAuth, etc.) are configured
4. **Monitoring**: Enable detailed logging during test execution

### Test Execution Process
1. **Prerequisite Verification**: Confirm all prerequisites before starting each test
2. **Step-by-Step Execution**: Follow test steps exactly as written
3. **Evidence Collection**: Take screenshots for critical test results
4. **Issue Documentation**: Log all issues with detailed reproduction steps
