## Facilitator Script & Protocol

### Session Structure (50-60 minutes total)

#### Part 1: Introduction (5 minutes)
**Script**:
"Hi [Participant Name], thank you for your time today. My name is [Your Name], and we'll be walking through some new features in our application.

I want to be clear: **we are testing the application, not you.** There are no right or wrong answers. Your honest feedback is the most valuable thing you can give us.

As you work through the tasks I give you, I'm going to ask you to **think out loud**. Please tell me what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you expect to happen. The more you talk, the more it helps.

I may not answer all of your questions directly, because we want to see how you would solve problems if you were on your own. But please ask anything that comes to mind.

Finally, with your permission, we'd like to record the session (screen and audio) to help our team review the feedback later. Is that okay with you?"

#### Part 2: Task Execution (35-45 minutes)

**Facilitator Prompts**:

**To understand mental models**:
- "What are you looking at on this screen?"
- "What do you think that button/link does?"
- "What were you expecting to see here?"

**To probe hesitation or confusion**:
- "I noticed you paused there for a moment. Can you tell me what you were thinking?"
- "What's going through your mind right now?"
- "How does this compare to what you expected?"

**To redirect without giving answers**:
- "If you were using this on your own, what would you try next?"
- "Is there another way you might approach this?"
- "What would make this easier for you?"

**Important**: Only intervene when absolutely necessary. Let users struggle briefly—their struggle reveals important usability issues.

#### Part 3: Post-Test Debrief (10-15 minutes)

**SUS Questionnaire Administration**:
"Thank you, that was incredibly helpful. First, I'd like you to fill out this short 10-question survey about your experience."

**SUS Questions** (5-point Likert scale: Strongly Disagree → Strongly Agree):
1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently.
2. I found the system unnecessarily complex.
3. I thought the system was easy to use.
4. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.
5. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.
6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.
7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.
8. I found the system very cumbersome to use.
9. I felt very confident using the system.
10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.

**Open-ended Debrief Questions**:
- "What was your overall impression of the system today?"
- "What was the single most frustrating or confusing part of the experience?"
- "Was there anything that was particularly easy or pleasant to use?"
- "If you could change one thing you saw today, what would it be and why?"
- "How does this compare to other similar tools you've used?"

## Appendices

### Appendix A: SUS Scoring Calculator
```
For each participant:
1. Odd questions (1,3,5,7,9): subtract 1 from user response
2. Even questions (2,4,6,8,10): subtract user response from 5  
3. Sum all converted scores (range: 0-40)
4. Multiply by 2.5 to get final SUS score (range: 0-100)

Example:
Responses: [4,2,4,2,4,1,5,1,4,2]
Converted: [3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,3,3] = 33
